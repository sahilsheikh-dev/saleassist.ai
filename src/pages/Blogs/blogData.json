Devise an omnichannel experience</h3> <div class='blogDetails-1'><img src='/blog/1b3.png' alt='blog - 1'/></div><p>When it comes to contacting businesses, not all clients favor the same method. While some people prefer to obtain support via live chat, social media, or a messaging app, others prefer to send an email, and still, others prefer to call.</p><br/> <p>You never know which channel clients may use to contact you. More than 35% of consumers want to speak with the same customer support representative regardless of channel.</p><br/> <p>To prevent losing out on consumer communication and to provide efficient help, your company should offer various touchpoints for contacting customer care.</p><br/> <p>Brands can learn from IKEA and perfect the omnichannel experience for their consumers. Customers may utilize the internet tools to construct their space online, bringing the showroom to them.</p><br/> <p>Customers may purchase online and pick up their items the same day at their local shop. Furthermore, the Swedish behemoth can flawlessly manage the installation of any order!</p><br/> <h3>2. Deliver a hyper-personalized experience on your website</h3> <div class='blogDetails-1'><img src='/blog/1b4.png' alt='blog - 1'/></div><br/> <p>A thorough understanding of client behavior is essential for providing a hyper-personalized experience. To provide such an experience, a company must first invest in technology and solutions that give access to critical client information. </p><br/> <p>Websites may be an excellent tool for customization.</p><br/> <p>Brands may use real-time data and artificial intelligence (AI) to augment the hyper customization strategy and provide consumers with appropriately tailored services. It will make it easier for customers to communicate with businesses via live chat, video chat, co-browsing, or chatbots.</p><br/> <h3>3. Map customer journey to serve better</h3> <br/> <div class='blogDetails-1'><img src='/blog/1b5.png' alt='blog - 1'/></div><br/> <p>The goal of mapping a customer journey is to understand how consumers move via various touchpoints and how they view your company at each stage of the journey.</p><br/> <p>To map a client journey, you must first understand the touchpoints via which a customer might contact your brand. Touchpoints may be anything from your website to social media advertisements to your customer support personnel, on-site reviews or customer feedback, or surveys.</p><br/> <p>You must then understand the customer's activities for each step, their goals, whether they have any reservations, and the challenges they confront in each stage.</p><br/> <h3>4. Use past customer experience to tailor your messaging</h3> <br/> <p>Knowing your consumer better is always the first step toward providing customized interactions and experiences for them.</p><br/> <p>When historical customer data is accessible, the customer support team may access it and use previous orders or difficulties as examples to customize the experience.</p><br/> <p>When it comes to examples of personalization, Amazon outperforms the majority of companies. In fact, the e-commerce behemoth takes customized advertising to the next level by providing customers with contextually relevant offers and experiences.</p><br/> <p>Amazon not only tailors product suggestions based on a customer's purchase history and search history, but it may also employ algorithms to customize a customer's homepage.</p><br/> <h3>5. Adopt a conversational approach</h3> <br/> <p>Conversations with clients are an art form that businesses must perfect. Interactions between customers and businesses must seem like human dialogue, with no trace of automation.</p><p>Customers also demand to be handled as individuals, not as projects or opportunities, and this must be kept in mind at all times. Customers won't be loyal for long if they don't find the encounter pleasant and feel like they lack empathy. </p><p>Adopting a conversational approach should be the way to go if you want to improve the customer service experience (CX) and make discussions feel more person-centered.</p><br/> <h3>6. Leverage the power of Artificial Intelligence (AI) & Virtual Reality (VR)</h3> <br/> <div class='blogDetails-1'><img src='/blog/1b6.png' alt='blog - 1'/></div><br/> <p>Sixty-one percent of consumers said they would like to shop at stores that provide augmented reality experiences. More companies are using augmented reality and virtual reality technology to elevate consumer interaction and reshape the service and support environment.</p><br/> <p>Both are immersive methods that may be used to produce significant innovation in consumer experience and engagement. The goal of using AR and VR is to bridge the gap between real-world and online encounters and guarantee customers have the same sensory experience they get when they are in a store.</p><br/> <p>While no technology can replace actual product testing or interactions with agents, marketers can still integrate the best of AI, AR, and VR to improve the consumer experience.</p><br/> <h3>7. Implement customer feedback and reviews </h3> <br/> <p>Customers want firms to listen to them and respond to their suggestions. 55 percent of respondents said they would cease using a company's products or services if it ignored their input.</p><br/> <p>Feedback may be a very useful tool for businesses to improve their products, services, and operations in order to keep up with their consumers' changing tastes. In fact, soliciting and collecting feedback is an excellent example of personalized customer service since it demonstrates to consumers that they are valued and that their ideas are respected.</p><br/> <p>The importance is not only in gathering feedback but also in adopting ideas so that clients may feel a sense of uniqueness. Any comment that is received should be handled professionally.</p><br/> <h3>8. Personalize your content </h3> <br/> <div class='blogDetails-1'><img src='/blog/1b7.png' alt='blog - 1'/></div><br/> <p>If your website displays the same material to all sorts of visitors, your customer interaction approach lacks personalization. In today's world, when personalization reigns supreme, your company simply cannot afford to talk individually to each visitor.</p><br/> <p>92 percent of marketers use content personalization in some capacity. Information personalization is essential because it allows you to provide distinct content and calls to action (CTA) to each visitor. Customers must feel as though the website is tailored to them, which can only be achieved by displaying customized content.</p><br/> <p>As a result, marketers might consider harnessing all available consumer data, particularly those connected to location and demographics, to make their content strategy more potent and tailored.</p><br/> <h3>Wrapping It Up </h3> <br/> <p>Personalized customer service may help you stand out from the crowd. Furthermore, tailored customer experience is not restricted to assistance but can be deployed across all customer touchpoints. Human touch is crucial in personalized customer service, but you can also scale it by integrating AI and VR to supplement their highly personalized experience.</p><br/> <p>Brands must quickly adapt to changing customer preferences and recognize that a tailored customer experience strategy is a new need. The emphasis should be on taking a tailored approach because this is the only method to build client confidence and enhance various KPIs.</p><br/> <p>Offer personalized customer service to your customers and improve engagements with tailored video solutions by SaleAssist.</p><br/> </div>"

        "blogDetails":"<h1>Co-browsing vs Screen sharing: Which One Is Better?</h1><div class='blogDetails'> <div class='' style=' justify-content: space-between;'> <p>Technology has changed the way businesses communicate with their consumers. A better customer experience justifies ongoing lead generation and client retention. Engaging clients entails not just keeping them informed about your product, but also assisting them in making efficient use of it.</p><br/> <p>Co-browsing vs Screen sharing is a fascinating argument that touches on many areas of how businesses interact with their consumers. Your consumers will never be able to optimize their returns on investment in your goods unless this is done.</p><br/> <p>More than 30% of customers anticipate live chat on your website, according to Forrester research.</p><br/> <p>The customer experience is evolving, and real-time involvement is gaining traction. As a result, it is critical to leverage the most recent co-browsing vs screen sharing technology to improve communication with consumers, giving them the impression that they are sitting face to face with a customer service professional who is guiding them and addressing their concerns in real-time.</p></div><div class='blogDetails-1'><img src='/blog/2b1.png' alt='blog - 1'></div></div><div class='blogDetails'> <p>Visual involvement allows for a far better understanding of customer dialogues and the development of an emotional connection.</p><br/> <p>Complex transactions may be perplexing for clients, making them feel helpless. You may assist them with filling out forms, giving product demos, completing an order, paying checkout, and many other tasks by sharing the online browser or screen. </p><br/> <p>Both co-browsing vs screen sharing solutions are important for providing the greatest customer experience. We have provided a comparison study to assist you in determining which option is best for your company.</p><br/> <h3>What is co-browsing?</h3> <div class='blogDetails-1'><img src='/blog/2b2.jpg' alt='blog - 1'></div><br/> <p>Co-Browsing, also known as collaborative surfing, is a strategy described by the simultaneous browsing of the same web page by a corporate representative and a consumer in a real-time scenario. </p><br/> <p>Co-browsing occurs when the agent instantaneously connects with the customer's browser. Both the agent and the client can use this functionality to scroll and control the customer's page.</p><br/> <p>The powerful WebRTC technology used in the co-browsing solution enables smooth peer-to-peer communication and successful interaction. It facilitates comprehensive engagement between the agent and the consumer by offering live chat and video chat at the same time.</p><br/> <br/> <h3>Some of the key use cases of using co-browsing are</h3> <br/> <p>Customer Support: Customers frequently encounter issues while using the product and need real-time support to resolve them. Co-browsing enables you to serve consumers digitally and fix their problems without requiring them to switch to a separate tool.</p><br/> <p>Sales: The co-browsing tool assists your sales personnel in providing consumers with a clear knowledge of product functioning. It is more compelling to consumers and increases the likelihood of sales conversion. It also offers real-time sales help to your website visitors when they complete a transaction or fill out a form.</p><br/> <p>Product Demos: Product videos on websites do not always fully explain the product. Co-browsing allows your clients to become intimately acquainted with your goods. This assists them in selecting the best product to utilize in their organization.</p><br/> <p>Customer on-boarding: Due to a lack of technical understanding, customers may encounter difficulties setting up your product. Co-browsing also assists customers in real-time understanding of your goods, resulting in a smooth and delightful experience. </p><br/> <p>Document browsing: You may miss out on critical information while exchanging information with your clients, which can have a detrimental impact on your business. With co-browsing, you can walk consumers through papers and presentations, covering every detail without missing a beat.</p><br/> <h3>What is screen sharing?</h3> <br/> <div class='blogDetails-1'><img src='/blog/2b3.png' alt='blog - 1'></div><br/> <p>Screen sharing allows you to share your screen with your customer care person, who will have full access to it. Screen sharing allows agents to view a customer's desktop screen with a simple click, allowing clients to better comprehend what is going on. Guiding and explaining to consumers on their screens builds confidence between the employee and the customer.</p><br/> <p>Screen sharing, also known as screen mirroring, is a technique for resolving difficulties in real-time, making it an excellent choice for technical support executives and sales teams. Using a screen-sharing application saves time, energy, and allows for more efficient work.</p><br/> <h3>Some of the key use cases of using screen sharing are</h3> <br/> <p>Team collaboration: By employing graphics to highlight insights from research and development, screen sharing aids in the sharing of company ideas and presentations with team members.</p><br/> <p>Sales: Screen sharing allows sales professionals to show clients how your products or services might benefit their business, increasing the likelihood of a transaction conversion.</p><br/> <p>Product Training: Your team's ability to know everything about the product is critical. Screen sharing sessions are the most effective approach to train and lead users through the product step by step.</p><br/> <p>Technical support: For improved customer satisfaction, screen sharing provides real-time solutions and guides to resolve concerns.</p><br/> <h3>Co-browsing Vs Screen sharing: Make the right choice for your business</h3> <br/> <p>It is critical to understand the program's benefits and drawbacks while selecting the software for your organization. The distinction between co-browsing vs screen sharing, as well as what is ideal for you based on the advantages to your business growth, must be considered. Co-browsing vs Screen sharing may be advantageous to firms in a variety of industries.</p><br/> <p>When it comes to co-browsing vs screen sharing, each technology has its own set of advantages and disadvantages. Many businesses use co-browsing software because it provides the greatest collaboration technology for customer service. With these tools, you can provide outstanding customer service while also accelerating business growth.</p><br/> <h3>Understand your business needs</h3> <br/> <p>Before you invest in any software for your organization, you must first understand its requirements. Choosing the proper tool is critical since it will be used to connect with consumers. The greatest tool is one that combines cutting-edge technology with an intuitive user interface.</p><br/> <p>Remote assistance is more difficult to use than co-browsing vs screen sharing. Furthermore, it improves user security by restricting the amount of system access granted to your support team member. Specifically, if a user is having trouble with a browser-related issue, your support team may walk them through it via co-browsing.</p><br/> <p>What is the objective of using co-browsing vs screen sharing?</p><p>Where I am going to implement this? Will this be on my website or inside the app?</p><p>What other features do I need along with co-browsing? Do I need a video or live chat?</p><p>Do you expect your customers to download any plugin or not?</p><h3>Select the tool with video and live chat support</h3> <br/> <div class='blogDetails-1'><img src='/blog/2b4.jpg' alt='blog - 1'></div><p>Co-browsing vs screen sharing - confused? </p><br/> <p>Choose a tool that combines video chat with live chat to deliver comprehensive engagement through peer-to-peer contact. By combining the characteristics, the agent is able to deliver the finest support in addressing client concerns, giving customers happiness, and improving customer experience.</p><br/> <h3>Tips for selecting the best tool</h3> <ul> <li>Is the tool is built with WebRTC technology?</li><li>Does it provides instant access or require a download?</li><li>Can simultaneously support video chat and live chat?</li><li>What other features are supported with the engagement solution?</li></ul> <h3>WebRTC based solution for no downloads</h3> <p>Check to see if the tool uses WebRTC technology before making a final decision. It enables full involvement with your customers by combining co-browsing with live chat and video chat, resulting in a superior customer experience without sacrificing user experience.</p><br/> <p>Co-browsing designed with WebRTC-based technology does not require any downloads or plug-ins to use. Your consumers may share their browser with a simple click. It is compatible with all browsers and allows you to connect with the agent with a single click.</p><br/> <h3>Complete data security</h3> <p>By allowing business rules to be specified to disable read, modify, and submit actions on form components, the co-browsing tool provides excellent security. It allows you to view what your customers see when they visit your website. Especially those pages that have co-browsing scripts.</p><br/> <p>Data masking features provide maximum data protection to all sensitive client information by covering it with HTML elements or form fields. Agents cannot view or interact with specific parts, such as a credit card field that has been obfuscated within an e-commerce checkout.</p><br/> <h3>Deliver a better user experience</h3> <div class='blogDetails-1'><img src='/blog/2b5.jpg' alt='blog - 1'></div><br/> <p>Customer experience has evolved into a new currency for acquiring new consumers. Customers who are pleased with your products and services are more inclined to promote them to others.</p><br/> <p>Preferably, implement the tool that provides a better user experience. This is the most effective method of generating client happiness and should not be disregarded.</p><br/> <h3>Wrapping It Up</h3> <br/> <p>Most organizations' first objective is to deliver excellent customer service. Customer satisfaction will increase if you provide the greatest customer service possible.</p><br/> <p>The choice between co-browsing vs screen sharing is determined by your company's needs. Co-browsing is a developed type of screen sharing that is advised for e-commerce and online retail shops that deal with numerous customers at the same time and want to provide faster customer service.</p><br/> <p>The screen-sharing application, on the other hand, is great for startups and small organizations with limited bandwidth or financial resources. Screen sharing facilitates more integrated and collaborative customer/agent interactions.</p><br/> <p>However, co-browsing technology is employed to provide more agile solutions so that agents may improve the client journey. Co-browsing technology enables active guidance to consumers while also creating trust between them.</p><br/> <p>Explore the powers of co-browsing vs screen sharing with an added twist of video commerce with SaleAssist.</p><br/></div>"

At the end of the day, your business is nothing unless you have clients.</p><br/> <p>So, from the first encounter and on, one of the most crucial aspects of your business should be analyzing and refining the client experience.</p><br/> <p>Surprisingly, many businesses completely disregard the client journey, which is a huge mistake – especially when it comes to digital marketing agency efforts. Unless your organization sells impulsive buying items or services, the client journey should not be overlooked; rather, it should be catered to and cultivated with vigor.</p><br/> <p>The customer journey stages assist you in better understanding consumer behavior for your target demographic, which may give useful information to your team when designing a marketing plan.</p></div><div class='blogDetails-1'><img src='/blog/3b1.png' alt='blog - 1'></div></div><div class='blogDetails'> <p>So, what exactly are the customer journey stages, and why are they crucial when creating a marketing strategy?</p><br/> <p>In its most basic form, the customer journey is a snapshot of the whole customer experience, beginning with the consumer's first engagement with your company and brand and continuing with each subsequent interaction. It assists you in understanding consumer behavior during the purchasing process, as well as customer demands and expectations.</p><br/> <h3>What is a customer journey?</h3> <div class='blogDetails-1'><img src='/blog/3b2.png' alt='blog - 1'></div><br/> <p>When we say customer journey, we simply mean the interactions a user has with you from the time they first find you to the time they become a client. Instead of concentrating just on when or how a user concluded a deal, the customer journey considers the whole customer experience. </p><br/> <p>Marketers will benefit from this since they will have a better understanding of the function that each channel and piece of content plays in pushing consumers through their journey.</p><br/> <h3>What are the Customer Journey Stages?</h3> <p>Understanding the customer journey and refining the stages of the sales funnel are always critical to being competitive in the business. The more you understand about client touchpoints, the better you'll be able to service them.</p><br/> <p>As a result, you must completely grasp each stage of the client experience in order to strike the proper balance between what they desire and what you give.</p><h3>Awareness</h3> <p>The Awareness stage of the customer journey stages occur when your potential customer is aware that they have a need or an issue and is now investigating information and actively seeking answers to try to address their problem or need.</p><br/> <p>Consider the consumer journey's awareness stage to be your initial impression. As a result, raising awareness is a critical phase in the buyer's journey.</p><br/> <p>It is critical to deliver value to your prospects during this stage in order to develop trust and rapport with them. If you don't deliver properly at the Awareness stage, none of the other phases of the client experience matter.</p><br/> <p>To generate a solid first impression, you must first understand how more than 75% of internet users read blogs on a daily basis to learn about a product or business.</p><br/> <p>Aside from exchanging information, an effort must be made to create trust with clients. And if you couldn't achieve it, the rest of the phases would be meaningless.</p><h3>Evaluation</h3> <p>The Evaluation stage is the next step in the customer journey stages. Your prospects have done their preliminary research and are aware of some of the possibilities available to them. However, the research phase is not yet complete. They have restricted their alternatives, but they will continue to look for further information.</p><br/> <p>This is the stage where they compare your product or service to different market solutions. This is where customers compare prices, read customer reviews, research rivals, and learn more about the specifics of your product or service to determine whether it is, in fact, what they are searching for.</p><br/> <p>Knowing that your consumers will be comparing you to your rivals at this stage, it's crucial for you to take a step back and ask yourself if you're positioned well, knowing that your customers will be comparing you to other possibilities.</p><h3>Decision</h3> <p>The Decision stage is the third step in the customer journey stages, where your prospective client is ready to choose from their alternatives and make a purchase.</p><br/> <p>By this point, the potential buyer has completed all of the necessary research to be fully informed about which services would best meet their needs and which firms they feel will be the best fit. Customer feedback is very important at this level of the customer journey stages.</p><br/> <p>Displaying case studies to your prospects at this time is quite advantageous, as it will answer the question on your prospective buyer's mind, 'why should I select you?'</p><br/> <p>During the Decision stage, social evidence that your product or service performs what you claim it will do is critical. Solicit testimonials from prior customers and post them on your website and other locations where prospects may learn more about you, your company, and your brand. </p><h3>Retention</h3> <p>Customer Retention is the fourth step of thecustomer journey stages. Congratulations! If your consumers have made it this far, you must be doing something right. But the story isn't done yet. In fact, this is likely the most critical step of the consumer experience. Why?</p><br/> <p>Retaining a current client is significantly easier and nearly five times less expensive than acquiring a new one. It takes a lot of trust to convert a prospect into a first-time purchase, so after you've earned their confidence and their business, you should work hard to keep it.</p><br/> <p>You should be following up with your client at this point to acquire their opinion on the product or service that they purchased from you. You should thank them for their business.</p><h3>Advocacy</h3> <p>This is the final and most difficult step of the customer experience. This is the point in the customer journey stages when the client becomes a vocal supporter of your brand. They rave about you and your company, refer their friends and family to you, and provide the most potent type of promotion your company can have: word-of-mouth. So, how did your marketing department bring your consumer to this point?</p><br/> <p>The answer is to cherish, pay attention to, and respect them every step of the way through the preceding stages. You must also have a fantastic product or service that delivers precisely what you claim.</p><br/> <p>Simply asking your consumers to spread the news about your business is one of the most potent strategies to drive brand advocacy. I believe you will be astonished.</p><h3>Wrapping It Up</h3> <p>You can please your customers at every point of their purchasing journey after you thoroughly grasp their experience with your company. This trip may be influenced by a variety of elements, including consumer pain areas, emotions, and your company's touchpoints and processes.</p><br/> <p>The customer journey stages are the most efficient method to visualize this information, whether you're improving your path for the consumer or looking into a new business possibility to meet a client's unidentified requirements.

These are the tools that are used to streamline customer interactions across the customer journey:</p><h3>Video & voice chat </h3> <div class='blogDetails-1'><img src='/blog/6b2.png' alt='blog - 1'></div><p>Using video and audio chat allows support professionals to provide individualized client care in real-time.

Improve First Contact Resolution (FCR)</h3> <p>Consider the following scenario: A client must frequently contact the customer support team on the same issue since their original problem was not fixed the first time.</p><br><p>We've all had such an experience, which is really annoying and a solid cause to churn!</p><br><p>The ultimate goal of real-time interaction is to be able to view, engage with, and address client concerns.

        "blogDetails":"<h1>9 eCommerce Marketing Tips That Will Sky Rocket Your Sales Revenue</h1><div class='blogDetails'><div class='' style=' justify-content: space-between;'><p>It is not simple to run a successful eCommerce business. That's why we've compiled a list of 9 useful eCommerce marketing tips to help you expand your company.</p><p>But, before we go into the recommendations themselves, let's define what we mean by eCommerce marketing tips.</p><h3>What is eCommerce marketing?</h3><p>Ecommerce marketing encompasses all promotional efforts aimed at increasing visitors to and sales from your online business. This covers both attracting customers who have never shopped at your store before to buy for the first time and getting customers who have previously purchased to buy again.</p></div><div class='blogDetails-1'><img src='/blog/8b1.jpg' alt='blog - 1'></div></div><div class='blogDetails'><p>Although shoppers' final destination is an online store, eCommerce marketing can take place either offline or online. It is hard for online merchants to build a brand into a successful eCommerce business without eCommerce marketing.</p><h3>9 eCommerce Marketing Tips That Can Take Your Business To New Heights</h3><p>Now that we've discussed what eCommerce marketing is, let's look at some eCommerce marketing tips to assist you in enhancing it.</p><h3>eCommerce Marketing Tips #1: Optimize Your Website As Per Mobile</h3><img src='/blog/8b2.png'><p>According to the statistics, mobile has surpassed desktop in terms of market share, with roughly 55 percent vs 43 percent. As a result, each modern business must have a responsive, mobile-optimized website. In fact, having a high-quality mobile experience is increasingly critical to increasing conversions in your online business.</p><h3>eCommerce Marketing Tips #2: Reduce Shopping Cart Abandonment Rate</h3><img src='/blog/8b3.png'><p>Cart abandonment is a major source of irritation for eCommerce firms. Consumers get so close to purchasing from you, and then, poof, they're gone. And, with an 88 percent worldwide shopping cart abandonment rate in 2020, that's a lot of income and prospective consumers lost.</p><p>There are several reasons why website users quit their shopping carts, ranging from clumsy purchase processes to hidden fees. However, everything is not lost. You may mitigate this by optimizing your shopping cart.</p><h3>eCommerce Marketing Tips #3: Offer High-Class Customer Support</h3><img src='/blog/8b4.png'><p>The eCommerce industry is about more than simply high-quality items and trendy designs. Obviously, this helps, </p><p>but in order to truly stand out, you must deliver exceptional customer service.</p><p>And these days, that means adopting an omnichannel strategy, which entails assisting prospects and customers across many channels and considering each contact or touchpoint (e.g., SMS, chatbots, live chat) as part of a unified, seamless whole.</p><p>A fantastic method to accomplish this is to use a customer experience platform to create a unified customer view, which brings all customer contact data under one roof.</p><h3>eCommerce Marketing Tips #4: Leverage The Power of Social Media</h3><p>Social networking is an excellent supplement to your eCommerce marketing efforts. Including items in your Instagram photos, coupled with some relevant hashtags, can lead to a more direct path to purchase.</p><p>A Facebook store is another viable option, providing an additional platform for selling your stuff. They are quite simple to set up and maybe connected with current systems like Shopify, eliminating the need to manage inventory separately.</p><h3>eCommerce Marketing Tips #5: Recognize and Reward Loyal Customers</h3><p>Repeat consumers are the lifeblood of your brand. And implementing loyalty programs as an incentive is one of the best ways to keep people coming back.</p><p>It is totally up to you how and why you reward your consumers. You may, for example, give them reward points that they can use to acquire free items, discount coupons, or free delivery. It also pays to customize your loyalty program so that your clients only receive incentives that are relevant to them.</p><p>Not only will your consumers be rewarded, but so will your company.</p><h3>eCommerce Marketing Tips #6: Try Upselling and Cross-selling Products</h3><img src='/blog/8b5.png'><p>Upselling and cross-selling are excellent methods for increasing revenue. Often, your clients are unaware that you have a superior version of a product in-store, or they want more information to understand why a premium product is better suited to their needs.</p><p>Similarly, there may be other things that precisely complement the one they are purchasing that they are unaware of. Amazon has created a reputation for itself with this type of tailored product recommendation, employing the 'If you liked that, you'd love this' strategy.</p><h3>eCommerce Marketing Tips #7: Add Live Chat On Your Website</h3><img src='/blog/8b6.png'><p>Customers may use live chat to ask inquiries and voice concerns before making a purchase choice. It's also a chance for your agents to share product information and knowledge base articles with your customers, allowing them to make more educated selections.</p><p>This helps to eliminate any ambiguities, increasing your conversion rate while also improving your clients' purchasing experience.</p><p>Live chat may also be used deliberately to target website users on specific pages or after they've been on pages (such as product pages) for a given period of time, therefore increasing that all-important customer engagement.</p><h3>eCommerce Marketing Tips #8: Offer Real-time Customer Service</h3><img src='/blog/8b7.png'><p>The era of 'spray-and-pray' marketing is over. The contemporary client expects a purchasing experience that is personalized to their individual needs. The more relevant the deals you promote, the more likely people are to buy.</p><p>In fact, over three-quarters (74%) of online customers are irritated by websites with information (e.g., adverts, offers, promotions) that appears to be inappropriate to their interests.</p><p>Send customized marketing messages to clients based on their surfing history, interests, and choices. This ensures that they are correctly targeted and are more likely to evoke a reaction.</p><h3>eCommerce Marketing Tips #9: Offer Free Shipping</h3><p>If your company does not provide free delivery to its clients, it is time to consider introducing one.</p><p>Free delivery is a bit of a drawback. Indeed, many buyers, persuaded by companies like Amazon, have grown to anticipate it these days, even on lower-priced products. The benefit to your company is obvious: more sales and money.</p><h3>Wrapping It Up</h3><p>Running an online business will never be simple, but by following these eCommerce marketing tips and arming yourself with the appropriate tools, you can overcome any obstacles and considerably increase your chances of success.</p></div>"

Customers may also find cashier-free checkout, ticketing kiosks, and other amenities in physical places; however, they are significantly less widespread than online client self-service.</p><p>Just before you complete checkout, send them an order review summary.</p></div><div class='blogDetails'><h3>Why is customer self-service important?</h3><p>Customer self-service is essential since it improves the customer experience and support. Furthermore, self-service minimizes the frequency of routine interactions with live operators. This implies that agents will have more time to devote to difficult issues and consumer engagement.</p><br><h3>Benefits of customer self-service</h3><p> Here are the benefits of customer self-service:</p><h3>1. Reduced costs</h3><p>Self-service solutions are set up once and then utilized as a resource for every client or visitor at no further expense. Furthermore, your consumers do not have to engage the time of a customer service agent to acquire answers, lowering the overall cost of customer assistance.</p><h3>2. Faster support and higher efficiency</h3><p>When browsing through customer self-service portals, customers do not have to wait for a response. They can obtain fast responses to their inquiries. Certain self-service solutions, like chatbots, may even triage client complaints and automatically route the more complicated ones to human agents with context, enhancing customer care efficiency.</p><h3>3. Higher consistency and accuracy</h3><img src='/blog/9b2.png'><p>Unlike people, customer self-service always provides visitors with the same information in the same voice and tone. This lessens the possibility of misconceptions or misinformation.</p><h3>4. Better conversion rate</h3><p>Effective customer self-service tools assist customers in locating the information they require to purchase the correct product or service. Given that more than half of consumers leave their purchases if they can't find quick answers to their problems, self-service is one of the most effective strategies to increase conversions and decrease churn.</p><h3>5. Higher satisfaction</h3><img src='/blog/9b3.png'><p>Finding solutions swiftly is an important aspect of ensuring client happiness. Furthermore, 81 percent of consumers choose self-service as the initial step in resolving a problem before contacting employees. As a result, the lack of these alternatives may result in irritation and decreased pleasure.</p><h3>6. Additional resources for employees</h3><img src='/blog/9b4.png'><p>Employees can also use customer self-service platforms. Agents may simply use corporate knowledge bases or FAQs to inform their response to client concerns, rather than needing to recall everything by memory or risk making mistakes.</p><h3>Customer self-service: 4 Best Practices</h3><img src='/blog/9b5.png'><p>Consider the following recommended practices to make self-service support a successful customer service strategy:</p><h3>1. Integrate channels</h3><p>In general, the future of customer service is omnichannel. This covers self-service customer service. No channel should be left alone. As previously said, chatbots must be linked to living chat with human agents, both to boost efficiency and as a backup plan if they are unable to assist clients.</p><p>Knowledge bases should be linked to chat solutions as well. Knowledge base articles may be served by both chatbots and human agents. What clients type into the knowledge base search field may be used to inform FAQ pages. All self-service alternatives should be interconnected and flow into one another.</p><h3>2. Use interaction history</h3><p>Conversational and contextual customer service is the finest. Assuming you're utilizing an omnichannel customer service platform, this implies that each action a consumer takes may offer information to the support team about how to solve issues more effectively.</p><p>A platform that incorporates client self-service solutions, for example, allows agents to observe that a certain consumer has read certain help center articles or asked specific queries to the chatbot. This information will allow the agent to enter the interaction with the consumer knowing exactly what the problem is.</p><h3>3. Don’t set it and forget it</h3><p>Self-service is intended to allow customers to assist themselves, although it does need some work on the back end.</p><p>Tracking the efficacy of each channel and making modifications is a useful practice. Anything from the design of your knowledge base to chatbot scripts to rewriting lessons may make or break self-support.</p><h3>4. Ensure discoverability</h3><p>Having self-service choices is useless unless your clients are aware of them. For example, you must:</p><ul><li>Place a visible link to your FAQ page on your website (customers often expect to see it in the footer).</li><li>Create a clear site structure to house your knowledge base, and optimize it for SEO so that search engines can find it.</li><li>Using your customer support platform, create rules that will activate your chatbot when necessary. Also, make the bot accessible from all sites (e.g., via a pop-up) or in your mobile app.</li><li>Place popular video lessons or other content in their own area and link to it from relevant locations.</li></ul><p>And there's more. It all relies on how your customers use your website or app.</p><h3>Wrapping It Up</h3><p>Customer self-service is an excellent approach to provide better assistance, decrease staff overburden, and boost efficiency. You just need a plan that includes the self-service choices that your target audience expects.</p><p>Of course, you'll need the correct software — a platform that allows you to easily set up and improve workflows while also tracking the performance of your self-service solutions.</p><p>Leverage the full potential of customer self-service and optimize your customer experience with SaleAssist!</p></div>"

This is because companies have recognised the benefits of video chat technology, owing in large part to greater work-from-home opportunities and the development of digital purchases.</p><p>Rather of depending just on live chat or chatbots, including video chat will allow you to provide more personalised experiences to your consumers.</p><p>However, like with any technology, selecting the right business tools and properly applying them is critical to success. So, here's all you need to know about customer support video chat technolog.</p></div></div><div class='blogDetails'><h2>What Is Video Chat?</h2><p>Antechnology such as Zoom, Skype, SaleAssist, and Google Hangouts.</p><p>.</p><p>Antechnology such as Zoom, Skype, SaleAssist, and Google Hangouts customer support options, is predicted to reach $1.28 billion by 2027.</p><h3></h3><p>For browser-based applications, video chat solutions employ Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) technology and, in certain cases, Web Real-Time Communication (WebRTC). You can have video discussions with consumers online using this technology on any device or browser.</p><p>Consider a consumer who phones from their mobile device to report a problem with a recent purchase. They're attempting to convey that it's faulty, but they don't know what technical phrases to use or what precisely is wrong with it.</p><p>That is when your support team might request that they join a video conference (with the right customer service platform, this is only one click away). The agent may then view the item, and clients can show the agent the precise problem they're having.</p><h3>How To Deliver Excellent Customer Service With Video Chat?</h3><p>Consider the following recommended practises to ensure video chat functions properly as a customer care tool:</p><h3>1. Go Omnichannel</h3><p>This is a significant one. Customer satisfaction cannot be ensured just through video chat. What clients actually want is to be able to go from one digital channel to another without having to restart their interactions.</p><p>As a result, video chat must be smoothly connected with live chat, phone, chatbots, email, SMS, and other systems. This way, if your staff is chatting with a customer on live chat, they may decide whether to switch to video chat if necessary.</p><h3>2. Train Your Agents</h3><p>In general, train your customer care crew. However, train them expressly for video chat as well. Face-to-face contact puts both parties under strain. As a result, agents must be able to regulate their body language and utilise nonverbal clues to steer the discussion in the proper direction.</p><p>It is always beneficial to train your agents how to interact effectively across numerous media. You may define tone and voice standards for video chat in the same way you would for social media postings.</p><h3>3. Inform Customers About The Video Option</h3><p>The presence of a video chat solution does not always imply that clients are aware of its presence. Some may find it by chance, while others may not.</p><p>Consider a consumer who travelled all the way down to your physical shop or delivery facility to show a product issue, only to discover they could have done it from home via video chat. That will have a significant negative influence on the consumer experience.</p><p>The good news is that even if consumers don't use video chat, knowing you're creative and care about customer experiences enough to have it in the first place is a terrific approach to gain their confidence.</p><h3>4. Choose the Appropriate Vendor</h3><p>Not all video chat software is the same. As a result, it is critical that you select a solution that is a suitable fit for your organisation and needs. Here are a few things to think about:</p><h3>Employee Experience</h3><p>It's all too easy to lose sight of the agent's role and focus only on the consumer. However, making things easier for your staff is a need for providing outstanding CX. So, while selecting customer service solutions, consider how simple it is for your staff to learn, use, and set up each product.</p><h3>Scalability and Efficiency</h3><p>Since video consumes more bandwidth than other forms of online communication, it's critical that your product be lightweight and consistent over varied internet connections. If a video chat's picture or voice is cut off in the middle of a conversation, the entire purpose is defeated.</p><h3>Integrations</h3><p>Customer service video chat can only succeed if it works in concert with other systems. As a result, the greatest software solutions usually have the ability to integrate with other technologies. You may need to interface with your CRM or ticketing software, for example. Integrations with AI-powered bots are frequently required.</p><h3>Security And Privacy</h3><p>You're probably already considering security while purchasing software. However, especially when it comes to video chat for customer support, you must guarantee that the consumer is also aware that it is secure. Choose technologies that can provide end-to-end encryption and broad data protection, but also have security badges and can explain how they secure privacy.</p><h3>5. Collect Feedback and Analyze Results</h3><p>After implementing video chat, make sure you monitor the outcomes. You may check your platform to see how many video conversations were held, how many were successful, and how many were not. It all contributes to gaining insight into whether or not it is effective for your company and its target audience.</p><p>Another excellent strategy is to actively solicit feedback from customers. In your frequent surveys, you may include questions. Alternatively, send out separate questionnaires to clients who utilised the product.</p><p>Then, take action based on the input. If you need to change tools, retrain your agents, buy better equipment, or do anything else, it will all benefit your client experience in the long term.</p><h3>Wrapping It Up</h3><p>While video chat is most commonly used by organisations for certain use cases, it may have various different applications based on your operations. Video chat solutions, for example, may boost corporate interactions as well as client connections.</p><p>In addition, depending on your industry, video chat might be utilised for purposes other than technical help. It may be used to onboard new users, demonstrate new products, and more.</p><p>The main conclusion is that there are several methods to maximise your investment in a video chat platform. Examine your use cases and experiment as necessary.</p><p>Looking to integrate video chat in your customer service channels?</p><p>Sign up for SaleAssist today and get the most out of video ecommerce!</p></div>"

To do this, you must execute e-commerce shopping cart optimization.</p><p>A seamless checkout procedure is essential for providing this experience to an ever-increasing number of digital shoppers.</p><p>Fortunately, owing to advancements in technology, building the ideal checkout procedure is now much more attainable than in the past.</p><h2>Why you should optimize your shopping cart?</h2><p>The shopping cart checkout procedure begins when a consumer thinks they have everything they want in their basket and are ready to place their order.</p><p>This is vital to evaluate since it helps us realise that the consumer has a sense of urgency.</p><p>They have already spent time browsing through items and descriptions, selecting sizes, colours, and other options, and they want the process to be over as soon as possible. They may easily bounce if they find it difficult.</p><p>For people who are unfamiliar with the notion of a shopping cart, try following e-commerce platforms for suggestions on how the finest shopping cart checkouts function.</p></div></div><div class='blogDetails'><h3>Step by Step Process of eCommerce shopping cart optimization</h3><p>Let's dive into the details a bit more.</p></div><div class='blogDetails'><h3>1. Provide an order summary</h3><p>The most apparent and important aspect of the checkout page is allowing your users to see exactly what they are going to purchase.</p><br><p>Offering comprehensive openness aids in the development of trust. Customers don't want any unpleasant shocks when they open their supplied package.</p><p>Just before you complete checkout, send them an order review summary.</p></div><div class='blogDetails'><h3>2. Add live chat on your website</h3><p>Several studies have found that adding a live chat function to your website improves conversion rates and increases eCommerce purchases.</p><br><p> That's because live chat gives clients a fast method to acquire product information (and more, such as shipping choices and prices) before they buy.</p><p>This not only keeps them informed about their goods but also fosters mutual confidence between customers and the eCommerce company.</p><p>For example, if you offer a laptop to a consumer, they may be curious about its features, benefits, projected delivery time, or even whether you have it in stock or in a different colour.</p><p>Instead of having consumers phone or email you, live chat allows you to deliver these facts immediately, ensuring that customers do not abandon their purchasing basket due to a lack of information.</p><h3>3. Make the checkout process mobile-friendly</h3><p>Even if your eCommerce website is mobile-friendly, how does your cart checkout procedure fare? Is your checkout page responsive to mobile users?</p><p>If it isn't, it should be. Mobile devices are being used by many more people than ever before to browse and purchase. You must make your checkout pages mobile-friendly or risk losing clients.</p><p>For example, clients who visit sites that aren't mobile-friendly may discover:</p><ul><li>The text looks to be very tiny and difficult to read.</li><li>Product visuals are really tiny and impossible to read.</li><li>Adding the item to the shopping basket obscures the total pricing and other details.</li></ul><p>Because of the aforementioned difficulties, the cart abandonment ratio rises. If you want to increase sales and conversion rates, mobile commerce shopping cart optimization for checkout pages is a requirement.</p><h3>4. Try To Ask only relevant questions</h3><p>Users may exit during the checkout process if they do not want to provide any further information about themselves with the website, which they believe may jeopardise their privacy.</p><p>Or they just do not have the time to go through several pages and clicks to place their order.</p><p>As a result, it's usually a good idea to keep questions relevant and to restrict the number of steps required to finish the checkout process to a minimum. Always attempt to put an important product or price-related inquiries together on protected pages.</p><h3>5. Make Your layout more readable</h3><p>When an e-commerce shopping cart checkout is formatted in a way that makes it easy for a user to read, it looks beautiful. The checkout page's content should be straightforward and basic. Use a legible table-based structure so that your consumers can readily see product characteristics such as size, colour, price, description, and reviews.</p><h3>6. Avoid using excessive fields</h3><p>Being overly demanding of consumer information might harm the purchasing experience. When purchasing online, users always prefer a clean and straightforward experience, and they anticipate the same throughout their shopping cart checkout.</p><p>The key problem is to provide all important information to clients at the time of checkout without overwhelming them. If there are too many fields on the checkout page, it takes a long time to fill them all out, and customers may begin to question why you require so much information.</p><p>When a consumer becomes dissatisfied, they are only a click away from terminating the entire transaction.</p><h3>7. Offer multiple payment options</h3><p>Customers' final destination on your website is your basket checkout page. And it's a significant one. People are wary of their money and want to know that everything will be simple and safe.</p><p>Creating a straightforward, user-friendly payment procedure, on the other hand, will increase client trust. When creating payment pages, there are a few things to bear in mind.</p><p>To begin, allow clients to pay using a variety of payment options, including their digital wallets. Some websites still only accept one payment method, resulting in eventual cart abandonment.</p><p>In addition, several websites require users to join up before making a purchase. This creates an unnecessary barrier to purchase and drives buyers away. A guest login is a critical component of your cart checkout procedure.</p><p>If you want customers to join up, give them the opportunity and let them select; as an incentive, you may offer them free delivery or discounts on their next purchase.</p><h3>8. Make your customers trust you</h3><p>It takes a lot of time and works to gain the confidence of users. However, in order to enhance conversion rates and develop your eCommerce brand, shoppers must feel secure.</p><p>Customers should first and foremost feel secure when inputting their credit card information on your website.</p><p>There are several ways to demonstrate the trustworthiness of your website and persuade people to purchase there.</p><ul><li>Use of security logos and trust marks</li><li>Social proof</li><li>Contact Details</li></ul><h3>Wrapping It Up</h3><p>A simple online shopping cart checkout procedure may boost your online business's earnings and reduce cart abandonment.

According to Meticulous Research, the video conferencing market would increase at a compound annual growth rate of 15.5 percent from 2021 to 2028, reaching a staggering $24.4 billion by 2028. </p><p>In comparison, the market for live chat, which is one of the most popular customer support options, is predicted to reach $1.28 billion by 2027.</p><h3>How Does The Video Chat Work?</h3> <p>For browser-based applications, video chat solutions employ Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) technology and, in certain cases, Web Real-Time Communication (WebRTC). You can have video discussions with consumers online using this technology on any device or browser.</p><br><p>Consider a consumer who phones from their mobile device to report a problem with a recent purchase. They're attempting to convey that it's faulty, but they don't know what technical phrases to use or what precisely is wrong with it.</p><p>That is when your support team might request that they join a video conference (with the right customer service platform, this is only one click away). The agent may then view the item, and clients can show the agent the precise problem they're having.</p><h3>How To Deliver Excellent Customer Service With Video Chat?</h3> <img src='/blog/12b2.jpg'/> <p>Consider the following recommended practices to ensure video chat functions properly as a customer care tool:</p><h3>1. Go Omnichannel</h3> <p>This is a significant one. Customer satisfaction cannot be ensured just through video chat. What clients actually want is to be able to go from one digital channel to another without having to restart their interactions.</p><p>As a result, video chat must be smoothly connected with live chat, phone, chatbots, email, SMS, and other systems. This way, if your staff is chatting with a customer on live chat, they may decide whether to switch to video chat if necessary.</p><h3>2. Train Your Agents</p><p>In general, train your customer care crew. However, train them expressly for video chat as well. Face-to-face contact puts both parties under strain. As a result, agents must be able to regulate their body language and utilise nonverbal clues to steer the discussion in the proper direction.</p><p>It is always beneficial to train your agents how to interact effectively across numerous media. You may define tone and voice standards for video chat in the same way you would for social media postings.</p><h3>3. Inform Customers About The Video Option</h3> <img src='/blog/12b3.jpg'/> <p>The presence of a video chat solution does not always imply that clients are aware of its presence. Some may find it by chance, while others may not.</p><p>Consider a consumer who travelled all the way down to your physical shop or delivery facility to show a product issue, only to discover they could have done it from home via video chat. That will have a significant negative influence on the consumer experience.</p><p>The good news is that even if consumers don't use video chat, knowing you're creative and care about customer experiences enough to have it in the first place is a terrific approach to gaining their confidence.</p><h3>4. Choose the Appropriate Vendor</h3> <p>Not all video chat software is the same. As a result, it is critical that you select a solution that is a suitable fit for your organization and needs. Here are a few things to think about:</p><h3>Employee Experience</h3> <p>It's all too easy to lose sight of the agent's role and focus only on the consumer. However, making things easier for your staff is a need for providing outstanding CX. So, while selecting customer service solutions, consider how simple it is for your staff to learn, use, and set up each product.</p><h3>Scalability and Efficiency</h3> <p>Since video consumes more bandwidth than other forms of online communication, it's critical that your product be lightweight and consistent over varied internet connections. If a video chat's picture or voice is cut off in the middle of a conversation, the entire purpose is defeated.</p><h3>Integrations</h3> <p>Customer service video chat can only succeed if it works in concert with other systems. As a result, the greatest software solutions usually have the ability to integrate with other technologies. You may need to interface with your CRM or ticketing software, for example. Integrations with AI-powered bots are frequently required.</p><h3>Security And Privacy</h3> <p>You're probably already considering security while purchasing software. However, especially when it comes to video chat for customer support, you must guarantee that the consumer is also aware that it is secure. Choose technologies that can provide end-to-end encryption and broad data protection but also have security badges and can explain how they secure privacy.</p><h3>5. Collect Feedback and Analyze Results</h3> <img src='/blog/12b4.jpg'/> <p>After implementing video chat, make sure you monitor the outcomes. You may check your platform to see how many video conversations were held, how many were successful, and how many were not. It all contributes to gaining insight into whether or not it is effective for your company and its target audience.</p><p>Another excellent strategy is to actively solicit feedback from customers. In your frequent surveys, you may include questions. Alternatively, send out separate questionnaires to clients who utilized the product.</p><p>Then, take action based on the input. If you need to change tools, retrain your agents, buy better equipment, or do anything else, it will all benefit your client experience in the long term.</p><h2>Wrapping It Up</h2> <p>While video chat is most commonly used by organizations for certain use cases, it may have various different applications based on your operations. Video chat solutions, for example, may boost corporate interactions as well as client connections.</p><p>In addition, depending on your industry, video chat might be utilized for purposes other than technical help. It may be used to onboard new users, demonstrate new products, and more.</p><p>The main conclusion is that there are several methods to maximize your investment in a video chat platform. Examine your use cases and experiment as necessary.</p><p><i>Looking to integrate video chat into your customer service channels?</i></p><p><i>Sign up for SaleAssist today and get the most out of video eCommerce!</i></p></div>"

To do this, you must execute eCommerce shopping cart optimization.</p><p>A seamless checkout procedure is essential for providing this experience to an ever-increasing number of digital shoppers.</p><p><i>Shopping cart abandonment will no longer be an issue if you leverage the powers of <a href='https://my.saleassist.ai/auth/login'>SaleAssist</a> and offer a seamless customer experience!</i></p><p>Fortunately, owing to advancements in technology, building the ideal checkout procedure is now much more attainable than in the past.</p></div><div class='blogDetails-1'><img src='/blog/13b1.jpg' alt='blog - 1'></div></div><div class='blogDetails'> <h3>Why should you perform eCommerce shopping cart optimization?</h3> <p>The eCommerce shopping cart optimization procedure begins when a consumer thinks they have everything they want in their basket and are ready to place their order.</p><br><p>This is vital to evaluate since it helps us realise that the consumer has a sense of urgency.</p><p>They have already spent time browsing through items and descriptions, selecting sizes, colours, and other options, and they want the process to be over as soon as possible. They may easily bounce if they find it difficult.</p><p>For people who are unfamiliar with the notion of a shopping cart, try following e-commerce platforms for suggestions on how the finest shopping cart checkouts function.</p><h3>Step by Step Process of eCommerce shopping cart optimization</h3> <p>Let's dive into the details a bit more.</p><h3>1. Provide an order summary</h3> <p>The most apparent and important aspect of the checkout page is allowing your users to see exactly what they are going to purchase.</p><p>Offering comprehensive openness aids in the development of trust. Customers don't want any unpleasant shocks when they open their supplied package.</p><p>Just before you complete the checkout, send them an order review summary.</p><h3>2. Add live chat on your website</h3> <p>Several studies have found that adding a live chat function to your website improves conversion rates and increases eCommerce purchases.</p><img src='/blog/13b2.jpg'/> <p>That's because live chat gives clients a fast method to acquire product information (and more, such as shipping choices and prices) before they buy.</p><p>This not only keeps them informed about their goods but also fosters mutual confidence between customers and the eCommerce company.</p><p>For example, if you offer a laptop to a consumer, they may be curious about its features, benefits, projected delivery time, or even whether you have it in stock or in a different colour.</p><p>Instead of having consumers phone or email you, live chat allows you to deliver these facts immediately, ensuring that customers do not abandon their purchasing basket due to a lack of information.</p><h3>3. Make the checkout process mobile-friendly</h3> <p>Even if your eCommerce website is mobile-friendly, how does your cart checkout procedure fare? Is your checkout page responsive to mobile users?</p><p>If it isn't, it should be. Mobile devices are being used by many more people than ever before to browse and purchase. You must make your checkout pages mobile-friendly or risk losing clients.</p><p>For example, clients who visit sites that aren't mobile-friendly may discover:</p><ul> <li>The text looks to be very tiny and difficult to read.</li><li>Product visuals are really tiny and impossible to read.</li><li>Adding the item to the shopping basket obscures the total pricing and other details.</li></ul> <p>Because of the aforementioned difficulties, the cart abandonment ratio rises. If you want to increase sales and conversion rates, mobile eCommerce shopping cart optimization for checkout pages is a requirement.</p><h3>4. Try To Ask only relevant questions</h3> <img src='/blog/13b3.jpg'/> <p>Users may exit during the checkout process if they do not want to provide any further information about themselves to the website, which they believe may jeopardise their privacy.</p><p>Or they just do not have the time to go through several pages and clicks to place their order.</p><p>As a result, it's usually a good idea to keep questions relevant and to restrict the number of steps required to finish the checkout process to a minimum. Always attempt to put an important product or price-related inquiries together on protected pages.</p><h3>5. Make Your layout more readable</h3> <p>When an eCommerce shopping cart optimization is formatted in a way that makes it easy for a user to read, it looks beautiful. The checkout page's content should be straightforward and basic. Use a legible table-based structure so that your consumers can readily see product characteristics such as size, colour, price, description, and reviews.</p><h3>6. Avoid using excessive fields</h3> <p>Being overly demanding of consumer information might harm the purchasing experience. When purchasing online, users always prefer a clean and straightforward experience, and they anticipate the same throughout their eCommerce shopping cart optimization.</p><p>The key problem is to provide all important information to clients at the time of checkout without overwhelming them. If there are too many fields on the checkout page, it takes a long time to fill them all out, and customers may begin to question why you require so much information.</p><p>When a consumer becomes dissatisfied, they are only a click away from terminating the entire transaction.</p><h3>7. Offer multiple payment options</h3> <img src='/blog/13b4.jpg'/> <p>Customers' final destination on your website is your basket checkout page. And it's a significant one. People are wary of their money and want to know that everything will be simple and safe.</p><p>Creating a straightforward, user-friendly payment procedure, on the other hand, will increase client trust. When creating payment pages, there are a few things to bear in mind.</p><p>To begin, allow clients to pay using a variety of payment options, including their digital wallets. Some websites still only accept one payment method, resulting in eventual cart abandonment.</p><p>In addition, several websites require users to join up before making a purchase. This creates an unnecessary barrier to purchase and drives buyers away. A guest login is a critical component of your cart checkout procedure.</p><p>If you want customers to join up, give them the opportunity and let them select; as an incentive, you may offer them free delivery or discounts on their next purchase.</p><h3>8. Make your customers trust you</h3> <p>It takes a lot of time and works to gain the confidence of users. However, in order to enhance conversion rates and develop your eCommerce brand, shoppers must feel secure.</p><p>Customers should first and foremost feel secure when inputting their credit card information on your website.</p><p>There are several ways to demonstrate the trustworthiness of your website and persuade people to purchase there.</p><ul> <li>Use of security logos and trust marks</li><li>Social proof</li><li>Contact Details</li></ul> <h2>Wrapping It Up</h2> <p>A simple eCommerce shopping cart optimization procedure may boost your online business's earnings and reduce cart abandonment. Adopt these measures, and you'll be well on your way to delighting consumers.</p><p>Is your online store's shopping cart a touch clumsy? Do you believe there is space for improvement?

Long periods of social isolation, quarantine, and lockdown also changed purchasing customer behaviours.</p><p><i>Businesses aiming to re-enter the market in pre-pandemic capacities are now assessing current market demands. Easy down your efforts with one of the best live shopping solutions - SaleAssist!</i></p></div><div class='blogDetails-1'><img src='/blog/14B1-thumb.png' alt='blog - 1'></div></div><div class='blogDetails'> <p>In this blog, we will go through various tactics for changing customer behavior. These techniques will assist you in resuming your business following the epidemic.</p><h3>1. Meet old demands with new solutions</h3> <p>Unlike in the pre-pandemic era, individuals today strive for consistent savings, reduced spending, and a healthy work-life balance.</p><br><p>While this may make you believe that your company's products and services are doomed, connecting your items with your clients' basic expectations might help you gain a head start! Understanding how to provide a comparable service</p><p>while respecting the new customer lifecycle options can assist you in addressing the same problem in novel ways.</p><p>For example, if you used to teach a skill or an academic topic offline, switching to SaleAssist live classes and doing online sessions may be a far more practical alternative.</p><p>Because the epidemic has forced most individuals to spend the majority of their time indoors, giving your service through a screen may be the greatest change for your organisation.</p><h3>2.Establish a digital presence </h3> <img src='/blog/14B2.png'/> <p>Building a successful digital presence can do wonders for your organization, especially as the Internet becomes more popular due to its ease of use and adaptability.</p><p>Online platforms also enable you to provide customers with extra services like tokens and discounts, enhancing your long-term sales and customer loyalty.</p><p>One of the most significant consequences of the epidemic has been an increase in the amount of time individuals spend staring at their devices. According to Freshdesk research, almost 93 percent of clients appear to have almost totally migrated to online purchases.</p><p>As a result, it is critical to supply your services, in part or entirely, through digital means.</p><p>These platforms also provide better scalability, allowing you to reach a much larger audience. You may also work with a third party to develop and distribute referral links to promote your company.</p><h3>3.Focus on customer satisfaction</h3> <p>Because the lockdowns have been occurring on a regular basis for over two years, some firms may encounter a sudden imbalance of resources. This may prevent them from performing to their greatest potential.</p><p>However, because customers are unaware of this, their expectations of businesses stay unchanged.</p><p>Furthermore, with consumers being more cautious than ever before about where they spend, both pre-sale and post-sale customer service will have a significant influence on customer trust.</p><p>From purchase to post-purchase, this is an important moment for you to accompany your clients throughout their purchasing journey.</p><p>For example, if your online business has a delay in delivering some orders, it is critical to communicate this information to consumers rather than waiting for them to approach you first.</p><p>Having a well-prepared support crew that is ready and responsive will also be highly beneficial.</p><p>It is critical to provide remote assistance through IVR solutions, visual support, live chat, AI interactions, and other means in order to make your customers feel supported and appreciated.</p><p>SaleAssist Live Video Support is the latest in the offerings to give post sales support .</p><p>A consistent client experience may be a big element in deciding how your business grows today.</p><h3>4. Go the extra mile </h3> <img src='/blog/14B3.png'/> <p>Several studies have found that adding a live chat function to your website improves conversion rates and increases eCommerce purchases.</p><p>That's because live chat gives clients a fast method to acquire product information (and more, such as shipping choices and prices) before they buy.</p><p>This not only keeps them informed about their goods but also fosters mutual confidence between customers and the eCommerce company.</p><p>For example, if you offer a laptop to a consumer, they may be curious about its features, benefits, projected delivery time, or even whether you have it in stock or in a different colour.</p><p>Instead of having consumers phone or email you, live chat allows you to deliver these facts immediately, ensuring that customers do not abandon their purchasing basket due to a lack of information.</p><h3>3. Make the checkout process mobile-friendly</h3> <p>Surprising your consumers, especially when they least expect it, may help you distinguish yourself from the competition.</p><p>One way to keep your consumers is to collect feedback on a regular basis and analyze it thoroughly. After that, you may make some major adjustments to your product offers.</p><p>The improvements you make don't have to be necessary, but they will make your consumers feel unique and valued.</p><p>A sophisticated CRM software may assist you in understanding customer data in a way that defines the value each customer has for the business over the course of their relationship with the brand.</p><p>This allows firms to cater to clients in a unique way while also increasing customer loyalty.</p><h3>5. Expand your presence </h3> <img src='/blog/13b3.jpg'/> <p>As innovative trends for expanding sales and company develop on a daily basis, it is critical that you increase your presence across various offline and online channels of purchase.</p><p>Consumers are accustomed to experimenting with various modes of consumption as their availability and mobility improve. Buyers have also curtailed their offline purchases and are exclusively doing business online.</p><p>As a result, it is critical for every business that wants to flourish and expand its sales to be present on several platforms for buying and selling.</p><p>For example, whether a devoted client relocated physically during the pandemic or only shops electronically today, it is the brand's job to meet them where they want to be.</p><p>Because most products and services are now available online, a company's opposition will only end in its own loss.</p><h3>6. Endorse an easier lifestyle </h3> <p>Everything is getting smaller, comfier, and more easily available. Consumers nowadays want to spend the least amount of time, energy, and money while receiving the finest utilities and services.</p><img src='/blog/14B4.png'/> <p>To target a larger audience, modify your brand's offerings to make processes straightforward and uncomplicated for them. If you expect people to adapt to your way of doing things, you may lose them to a rival who provides them with what they want.</p><p>For example, when it comes to audio-visual entertainment, streaming services like Netflix and Amazon Prime always have an advantage over traditional cable services.</p><p>These platforms do not limit viewers' access to their favorite shows to a set time frame during the week. The service bends itself by offering various watching content available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, so that consumers may watch everything at their leisure.</p><h3>Wrapping It Up</h3> <p>The notion of returning to work in the same or greater capacity than before the pandemic may appear unattainable, but it is surely feasible with the correct amount of creativity and commitment.</p><p>Keeping your buyers at the center of your operations, actively striving to understand their wants and expectations, and implementing changes in how you work in accordance with the same are some sure-fire routes to success.</p><p>Serving consumers by providing products and services that meet their newly adopted lifestyles and imagining a digitally accessible business are some measures that can help you move your business closer to where you want it to be.</p><p><i>Don’t be worried about the changing customer behaviors, leverage the powers of live video commerce!</i><br/> <i>Contact SaleAssist for better assistance.</i> </p></div></div>"

The fact is that no business owner enjoys the prospect of losing consumers. However, in order to manage the rate of client churn (the rate at which you lose consumers over a particular length of time), you must first understand your data.</p><p>Customer churn rates will assist you in understanding what is going on in your company. Understanding how client retention and churn fit into the wider picture greatly aids in the development of various initiatives.</p><p><i>Increasing customer churn rate is the biggest hurdle for a majority of businesses, but not anymore!</i></p><p><i>SaleAssist offers unique video commerce and live commerce solutions to tackle this problem.</i></p><p>It's now a no-brainer that the effort to acquire and attract new consumers is inextricably linked to the struggle to maintain existing ones. In fact, when most business owners we deal with compute the true cost of client turnover, they have a 'oh no' moment.</p><p>In fact, it might result in a significant income loss. In essence, customer churn is inversely connected to revenue and customer happiness.</p></div><div class='blogDetails-1'><img src='/blog/15b1.png' alt='blog - 1'></div></div><div class='blogDetails'><p>Let's define what client turnover really implies.</p><p>According to Hubspot, customer churn is similar to customer attrition—the rate at which your clients terminate their engagement with you and cease earning money for your company.</p><p>Assume you began your firm with 500 clients and lost 25, giving you a customer churn rate of 5%. But why is it so important for businesses, you may wonder?</p><p>To answer briefly, the cost of losing clients is quite high for businesses. Customer churn demonstrates how excellent or terrible a company is at retaining customers on its side.</p><p>According to an Accenture report, businesses might lose up to $1.6 trillion each year due to client attrition.</p><p>Still not convinced? According to the same study, bringing a new client at the same level as an existing customer might cost up to 16 times more.</p><h3>What Are the Possible Reasons for Customer Churn?</h3><p>Turnover reasons might be personal or unique to each consumer. Let us attempt to categorize them.</p><h4>1. The Cost of Your Offerings</h4><p>Price has always been a subject of contention between consumers and sellers. It is also a difficult nut to crack for client sales managers. There is a greater likelihood of churn if your customers may locate more cost-effective alternatives. This is why it is critical for your product to bring value to the lives of your consumers and every dollar they spend. Typical solutions try to charge higher prices with agent/license based pricing model and company tend to pay more as they scale. SaleAssist pricing does not restrict you to number of agent/license and your pricing does not increase exponentially when you scale up.</p><h4>2. Product Information</h4><img src='/blog/15B2.png'/><p>Customers are also likely to switch if a product fails to meet market expectations. To prevent this, salespeople should be sufficiently rewarded for selling good-fit items to good-fit clients. Clients may come on board initially but leave in the long run if this is not the case. This occurs when consumers realize they are unable to address their issues using your solutions and goods.</p><h4>3. Product Usage Experience</h4><p>People are drawn in when they see a reasonably priced product with useful features. However, customers will only remain loyal if their purchasing experience is positive. This implies that there must be a seamless and easy-to-use interface with few issues—and simple troubleshooting in the event that problems do develop.</p><img src='/blog/15B3.png'/><p>If the user experience is not seamless, they will be less inclined to utilize it after a few attempts and will finally leave your customer 'basket.'</p><h3>4. Service and Experience with Customers</h3><p>Finally, the client's total experience must be excellent—not only in terms of product consumption but also in their interactions with your brand. This includes seamless business communication, marketing and branding material, social media initiatives, and interactions with salespeople and account managers.</p><p>Everyone wants to be heard and cared for. More significantly, they want to be embraced and loved by the communities they serve. Clients will go to a better-serving brand if they do not have a great experience with your brand.</p><h2>5 Notable Approaches to Customer Churn</h2><h3>1. Concentrate on Your Best Customers</h3><p>For many businesses, dealing with churn entails categorizing clients as cold customers or those who are likely to cancel. </p><p>This will assist you in refocusing your time and efforts in order to keep them on board.</p><h3>2. Be Proactive in Communicating</h3><p>When you reach out to your customers before they ask for you, you demonstrate how important they are to you. It also demonstrates your commitment to assisting customers in getting the most out of your product or service.</p><p>However, your old-school communication methods may no longer be effective. The message or template you give should be straightforward and demonstrate the value brought by your business.</p><p>For example, if someone joined up for your free trial and you observe that they aren't making use of all of the features, you may want to offer them a nice nudge.</p><h3>3. Provide Incentives for Your Offerings</h3><p>Give your consumers a cause to come back—promotional discounts, special offers, loyalty programs, and so on. This tiny gesture from you may go a long way toward demonstrating how concerned you are with your consumers.</p><p>However, there are a few aspects you should never overlook while building incentive systems, such as:</p><p>Age or Timeline of the Customer: If they are elderly or towards the conclusion of their time with you, build your tactics around renewal programs and reduced plans.</p><p>Customer Requirements: If you see that your customers are canceling because of mismatch or price difficulties, incentivize them to remain aboard while you work on generating upgrades that meet their needs and achieve their objectives.</p><h3>4. Gather Feedback Frequently</h3><p>Miscommunication or uncertainty about a product or service is the most common source of customer annoyance or aggravation that leads to churn. Another source of customer dissatisfaction is a lack of timely and competent help.</p><p>Because they are nebulous and hazy notions, resolving them is challenging. Getting to the bottom of client dissatisfaction necessitates identifying specific occasions when your representatives may have failed.</p><img src='/blog/15B4.png'/><p>You can only get these insights if you continually solicit feedback from your customers and request that each encounter be reviewed. You must develop a complete and closed-loop by making it simple for people to give in their feedback.</p><p>Aside from consumer feedback, it is also critical to consider your agents' experiences and perspectives. Furthermore, call analytics and data insights to assist in providing quantitative support for qualitative appraisals.</p><h3>5. Maintain Vigilance</h3><p>When churn occurs, identify it. If you wait until clients go, it will be too late to stop it. You can establish strategies and minimize churning by keeping an eye on data and insights.</p><h2>Wrapping it up</h2><p>Regardless matter how hard you try to prevent client churn, it is a problem that will affect any firm, large or small, startup or established.</p><p>You can undoubtedly boost customer pleasure and satisfaction if you utilize these churning points as topics to concentrate on. Data and analytics may help you interact with consumers and salvage relationships before they deteriorate.</p><p>You simply cannot afford to lose customers now that you understand the impact it may have on your business. Concentrate on becoming the savior of your business connections. While it is important to understand the causes of this churn, the majority of it comes down to bad customer service.</p><p><i>Provide your agents with the most up-to-date live video commerce solutions to supplement their expertise and guarantee optimal productivity.
